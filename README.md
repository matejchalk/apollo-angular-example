# Example of using GraphQL with Angular

This project serves as an example of how to combine Angular with [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/) and [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/docs/getting-started/index).

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

To run local GraphQL API (required by Angular app and code generator):

```sh
npm run api
```

To generate boilerplate (types and services), run:

```sh
npm run generate
```

To run Angular app with development server:

```sh
npm start
```
